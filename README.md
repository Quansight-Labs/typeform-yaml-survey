# typeform-yaml

This repository contains code to define Typeform survey using yaml, 
this is _explicitely_ a small subset of typeforms features. 

The goal is to be able to have collaborative editing of survey as yaml on 
GitHub and to _easily_ repeat and update those survey through time. 

Thus the Yaml must be fairly readable and minimal as anyway open-source maintainer 
can't spend an inordinate amount of time making too complicated surveys.
